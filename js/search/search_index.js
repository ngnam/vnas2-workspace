information\ninfo    : for informative status of the application (success, ...)\nwarning : for non-critical errors that do not prevent normal application behavior\nerror   : for critical errors that prevent normal application behavior\n\nExample usage:\n * import { Logger } from 'app/core/logger.service';\n *\n * const log = new Logger('myFile');\n * ...\n * log.debug('something happened');\n * ```\n\nTo disable debug and info logs in production, add this snippet to your root component:\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\nngOnInit() {\nif (environment.production) {\nLogger.enableProductionMode();\n}\n...\n}\n}\n\nIf you want to process logs through other outputs than console, you can add LogOutput functions to Logger.outputs.\n\n\n\n                        \n
